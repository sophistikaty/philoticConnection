<h3>our take on the best of #nolabooze after a first whirlwind trip.</h3>
<br>
<p>It's painful to try to put them in any kind of order. It's tough to get a bad meal in the big easy, but for us, Peche, Cane and Table, Atchafalaya, Shaya, and Bacchanal rose to the top of the foodie chain. Here's the run-down:</p>


sazerac, continental sour compere la pen
mimosa and michelada cane and table
pimm's cup carousel
milk punch or bloody mary atchafalaya

<h3>Sazerac at Compère Lapin</h3>
<a href="http://comperelapin.com/">Compère Lapin</a> is a ...worth noting continental sour

<h3>Milk Punch at Atchafalaya</h3>

  We were walking through the french quarter on our way to Cafe Du Monde on the first morning, stumbled across Cane and Table and drank our way through their entire brunch cocktail menu instead.

<h3>Let's be honest. It's hard to find a bad meal in nola</h3>
Not that we plan to try, but this is a freaking-awesome list amongst thousands of freaking-awesome options. Keep eating, nola eaters. Try it all, but if you're looking for the best - we say you give these spots a shot.

Until next time, nola.
