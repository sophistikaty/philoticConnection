//------------I Believe that We Will Win - Deep Thoughts on the World Cup

<p>The World Cup brings people together. It's probably more "Olympics" than the Olympics. Somehow it feels more pure. No matter who you are, where you grew up, if you had something like a ball, you played something like soccer. It is nostalgic and hopeful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>F&uacute;tbol might not be the most popular in the U.S. despite David Beckam's best efforts, but it is probably the most human game. Except maybe politics, but that's almost what makes #CopaMundial powerful. It's a different kind of diplomatic relations.</p>

<p>Speaking of coke, it normally makes for some pretty great commercials. Despite aforementioned idealistic feelings of hopeful nostalgia, to me, plenty of them take it so far they almost squash it, and end up with more of a flaky caricature than a beacon of hope. For example,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4pJ0VnWwE8&amp;list=PLp5eIoVz86mUhMyDiQXyRs5mZrhL3dpJL" target="_blank">Nike's real vs perfect team animations</a>.</p>
<p>For me, ESPN's "One Time Zone" commercial is much better. This pretty much captures it.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FIvGtnK5Xp8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>McDonalds actually did pretty great with this one too. Hormone and sugar pushing capitalists may capitalize, but hey, they're footing a hefty part of the bill too. And this message shows that (at least for the moment) they get it. Advertising - a necessary evil, and sometimes cultural artform.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-T7zyezBkuY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It is not just a game. We get so wrapped up, and emotional. Enough to cause a baby boom in the winning country?</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/L7v5pf0aN2Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There's so much to celebrate, so much personality comes out in a friendly, high-friction event, that it's easy to feel the love flowing over.</p>
<p><iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/MTFVUuX0FZF/embed/simple" width="300" height="300" frameborder="0" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></iframe> <iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/MThtQgDB0iD/embed/simple" width="300" height="300" frameborder="0" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></iframe></p>
<p>But it's not all love - and I don't just mean <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2SO8aonNXY" target="_blank">that nose kick in the US/Ghana game</a> (can't bring myself to embed that one, it's already involuntarily playing on repeat in my head). Some people say <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/world-cup-2014-racism-casts-shadow-over-soccers-big-event/#postComments" target="_blank">the world cup has a problem with racism</a>, and that's true, but isn't it really more accurate to say that the world has a problem with racism, to which the world cup events are not immune.</p>
<p>Racism does cast a shadow over more than the world cup, but I'd argue that much of what happens at the world cup also casts a shadow over racism. There should be concrete action taken to discipline people who take inappropriate actions in this vein, but love is always greater than hate, and it's a lot easier to believe what is done or said in ignorant hatred when you don't have anything to compare it to. The world cup gives people a chance to get to know, better understand, and maybe come to love people who are different from them.</p>
<p><iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/MTFzdBtJijO/embed/simple" width="300" height="300" frameborder="0" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></iframe></p>
<script async="" src="//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>So don't cry, at least not yet - the group stage&nbsp;isn't even over yet, and we're probably in for at least a few more moments like Messi's amazing goal, but nobody knows by&nbsp;who, or on which team's goal.</p>
<script async="" src="//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<script async="" src="//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>I think that exact uncertainty is a big part of what makes "the beautiful game" - especially on this scale - so beautiful. We come. We meet. We can almost leave&nbsp;monstrous problems on the sidelines. An even playing field. No armor.&nbsp;And for nintey minutes, it can almost feel like we are no longer out of touch&nbsp;because of money, violence, racism...the usual suspects.&nbsp;We can just be us. Just people.</p>
<p>Then, with all the anticipation, possibilitiess, fears, nerves, and uncertainty staring us down, we decide what our response will be. As for me. I believe that we will win.</p>

//--------------Hooked On #1

<p>This week we're listening to the following bands and so should you!!!!</p>
<h3>Alt-J - Breezeblocks</h3>
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/rVeMiVU77wo" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe></div>
<p>Watch the video...</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'll wait....</p>
<p>Really, watch it...</p>
<p></p>
<p>I found this song and fell in love with the amazing upbeat melody and riff plus a raspy voice is always great to hear. As I always do when I find an amazing song I look for a music video, mostly due to the fact that I want to share the song with other people and I've found that music videos are the best format for sharing since people will quickly judge a song that they hear and will not really pay attention if they don't quite get it. Instead if they have a music video that they are watching they are more likely to watch all of it and get a bigger experience than just listening to a song they've never heard before. Anyways, I digress; hopefully you've seen the video all the way through and are playing it over to see exactly what just happened.</p>
<p>SPOILER:</p>
<p>Well after doing some research it turns out that the band has said that the song was written about a guy who kills someone he's obsessed with by placing a breezeblock (cement block) on top of them effectively drowing them. However, in order to get the music video approved (not sure who approves them) they had to change the story to be a "justified murder." In this case it seems to me that a man walks into his own apartment to find his wife (the ring on her tied hands) in the closet. As he's comforting her another girl with a knife walks up behind him. The theory is that this women is either someone who the man has spurnned; cheated on her, had an affair, etc. Or that she loves him and thinks that getting rid of the mans wife would allow him to be with her. A fight ensues and he ends up killing her by using a cinder block to drown her which might be considered self defense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I find interesting is why did the wife who's tied up look so distraught even after seeing her husband? I mean not even a little relief was flashed in her face, maybe because she knew the girl was behind him, or maybe because the girl with the knife told her something that makes the wife feel angry towards him? Not sure, just interesting. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><br /> </p>
<h3>Aloe Blacc - The Man</h3>
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/HGy9i8vvCxk" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;The first song I heard Aloe Blacc on was "Wake Me Up" by Avicii but I didn't realize that until I listened to "The Man" and did some research. On "The Man" I love the hook: "I'm the Man... Yes I am, Yes I am, Yes I am." The song just has this amazing feeling to it, something missing in a lot of music but I think that I'm finding more and more artists who are going back to great music.</p>
<p>Look familiar?</p>
<p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-izTTZA3t5tc/TxSdWpy-8-I/AAAAAAAAAn8/D0YalTdKyqo/s1600/mlk3.jpg" /></p>
<p><br /> </p>
<h3><strong>Rosie Lowe - Right Thing</strong></h3>
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/7UBhcUbCqBs" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;Wow, just listen to the lyrics.</p>
<p><br /> </p>
<h3>Sam Smith - Money On My Mind</h3>
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/K0G9T5Bnjlc" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;Got to end this post with something upbeat! If you haven't heard of Sam Smith be ready to get tired of his name soon because I assure you he will explode into the mainstream soon! I just tried buying tickets to his show in Septempber and it sold out in a few hours. Crazy since his album isn't even out yet. Super mad but hopefully will catch him at some point. In the meantime lets dance!</p>

//-------------On the Properties of Plants

//-------------Danny Brown

<p><em>by @dgtlfi</em></p>
<p>Danny Brown is not someone I would recommend to everyone. He's an amazing rapper though, someone who's not shy of breaking the mold of what a rapper is "meant" to sound like by sampling some great songs and maturing into a mix genre artist. He's more than willing to do his own thing and experiment with different music as his backdrop but his flow is never weak.</p>
<p>You have to listen to "Grown Up" before you listen to any of his other music because not only is it one of my favorite music videos of all time it's also one of his most "radio friendly" songs where it resonates with everyone who listens to it without being "pop." His original album 'XXX' was a little more gritty than "Grown Up" but stayed true to his style - which is hard to name.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/NHfWY0is3rE" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p><br />The video is perfect. I wish I was that awesome growing up with awesome style and a sick flow. Plus it gets everyone to stop asking how he lost his teeth, genius!</p>
<p><br />His most recent album 'Old' is filled with hits from start to finish - seriously go listen to it. Songs like "25 Bucks" which is produced by Purity Ring from "Fineshrine" fame is a banger. That song just shows Danny Browns great love for music in all genres and his willingness to work with some of the best indie artists to make some great music.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/d0s0XHVUGF0" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p><br />"Dip" is another one of those hits that has a great sample but just has you banging your head from the very beginning all the while the lyrics hit each note with some grit. Like I said I wouldn't recommend Danny Brown to everyone but you have to love him!</p>

//----------Beard Care

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>by @dgtlfi</em></p>
<p>Welcome! Hopefully you&rsquo;ve purchased our <a href="http://philoticconnection.virb.com/shop/187836786" target="_blank">Philotic Connection Beard Oil </a>and you&rsquo;re ready to start taking control of your beard! Maybe you&rsquo;re on the fence on whether or not you should grow out your beard because of previous experiences and you just need some advice. Either way, we&rsquo;re here for you.</p>
<p>First, growing a beard is easy. Rule number one; don&rsquo;t shave. However, growing an awesome beard takes time, routine, and patience but it&rsquo;ll be worth every second when you get that compliment from&nbsp; random strangers or even better when your significant other loves your beard as much as you do and supports your beard growth. If they need some persuasion show them this:</p>
<p><img src="http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1365/af/5e28b262d954b234-beardpatience.jpg" class="right" style="text-align: right;" height="600" width="449" /></p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s talk about hair since your beard is not special in that regard.</p>
<p>There are thee different hair types and we mostly all fall into one of these categories: Fine, Medium, Coarse. Our head hair may fall into any of them but our facial hair usually always falls into the Medium/Coarse category. The difference is important. Let&rsquo;s say for instance that your normal hair type is Fine then you probably have soft hair and you are used to not having to use too much shampoo and conditioner to keep it soft. However, if your facial hair is coarse, then your hair will be thick, wiry, wild, and hard to comb. That means you&rsquo;ll have to be proactive about how you wash and condition the beard, that&rsquo;s where beard oil comes into play.</p>
<p>Sadly it&rsquo;s not that easy, not only do we have to worry about our hair type when deciding to grow a beard, we also have to be thinking of our skin type, otherwise we will never get past that dry/itchy phase. The different types of skin are: Normal, Dry, and Oily. Some of us might even have sensitive skin or a combination of the three but let&rsquo;s make this simple and stick to the three.</p>
<p>Your skin type will define your daily wash routine for you. For example, if you have normal skin, washing your face more than twice a day is not a bad thing, however; if you have Oily or Dry skin it may not be advised, especially if you&rsquo;re not prepared with a good conditioning/moisturizing routine. Why? Well the act of washing your hair means you are removing the natural oil (sebum) produced by the body from the hair and that can lead to dry hair or skin. Dry skin then leads to blemishes which causes the body to overcompensate and release more oil in an effort to moisturize the hair and skin but that usually leads to clogged pores which then lead to Acne and Blackheads. All in all a pretty bad experience but even more so when trying to grow out a beard.</p>
<p>The power of beard oil is that it helps with this process by telling your body not to overproduce any oil. How? Depending on the carrier oil that is used in your beard oil it will have different effects but here at Philotic Connection we use the most expensive and best 100% natural products to create our beard oil. We use a base of Jojoba Oil which is technically not an oil, it&rsquo;s really a type of wax, that is the closest to our natural sebum and is known not to clog any pores since it acts closest to our own natural oil. It also has some pretty great anti-microbial properties to help clean up any dirt and bacteria lingering in your beard. Using this base oil and our own essential oil mix we provide some of the best beard oil in the market by creating a unique and wonderful smell for your beard and acts as a leave-in conditioner. Our essential oil mix is specifically crafted to help target and prevent those blemishes and acne from ever popping up to keep your beard and skin happy.</p>
<p>Now that we know why beard oil is important lets talk about what a daily wash routine should be. When showering, most people&nbsp;usually wash their body with soap and their hair with shampoo and for guys, if we&rsquo;re good, we use conditioner. However, it can often cause chronic problems with the condition of the hair and skin underneath when you&nbsp;wash your hair with shampoo more than three times a week and that goes for our beards as well. We&rsquo;re currently working on creating a beard friendly shampoo that is free of sulfates and has the right amount of oils to promote healthy growth and shine but using your normal shampoo should be just fine for now. The important point to remember is to use our beard oil to condition your beard after every shower, not just the three days you shampoo your beard. After a while you can go down to three days, then to fewer times, but start with using our beard oil every day.</p>
<p>Usage:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>If you have oily skin, you probably use a daily face wash to combat acne, continue doing so.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Wash your beard with shampoo and rinse thoroughly.</li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re out of the shower pat dry your beard with your towel. (This prevents you from damaging your hair.)</li>
<li>Once your hair is dry, place five to ten drops of our beard oil onto your dry palm and spread over your fingertips.</li>
<li>Rub in beard oil onto your hair and massage your skin as you work through your beard (As time goes on, you should only be applying oil to the hair and not the skin but in the beginning your skin needs some love too.)</li>
<li>If you have a long beard you should repeat steps 4 and 5 until you feel that most of the beard is covered in oil. The beard shouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;wet&rdquo; or dripping with oil it should just be shiny.</li>
<li>Once you have rubbed in the beard oil, comb your beard down</li>
<li>This will spread the oil over the hair and should start training your hair to fall into place.</li>
<li>We recommend using a wooden comb but any long-tooth comb should work.</li>
<li>We also recommend combing down your hair every morning and night to help with its training</li>
<li>No matter the length of beard you&rsquo;re trying to achieve you will have to trim your beard regularly to prevent split ends and to just keep it from getting too out of control. Plus the act of trimming your hair actually stimulates growth. (Any ten dollar pair of shears should work.)</li>
<li>You want to focus on the hair on your cheeks that stick out even after a few combs. If you&rsquo;re going for a longer beard you should be trimming at least every three weeks, yes it will actually help with its growth. Remember you shouldn&rsquo;t be trimming too much, the best rule is &ldquo;Cut a little then sleep on it.&rdquo; You can always come back tomorrow to touch up some more but you can&rsquo;t grow back your hair in one night if you cut off too much.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>If you're already growing a long beard you should start this process now, it might take a little longer to see some results but keep at it and you&rsquo;ll see the benefits of softer hair, healthy skin, and a controlled beard.&nbsp; Also, keep coming back to check for an awesome new handmade product we&rsquo;re working on just for you to jumpstart the process.</p>

//-----------Antique Jewelry, the Shiny Time-Machine

<p class="p1"><em>by @sophistikaty</em></p>
<p class="p1">What you wear says a lot about you. How you're feeling. What role you're playing. Where you're going. What you're doing. Jewelry in particular probably says more, though often subtly, than just about anything you can put on. Watches, necklaces, earrings, cufflinks, bracelets, rings - whether by presence or absence - can carry substantial messages.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, I tend to be very future-oriented in most things, including fashion. I can be a pretty good technophile, but the juxtaposition of a beautiful antique (which may have been it's own cutting-edge technology of the time it was made) among all of my new technology makes me love both old and new more.</p>
<p class="right" style="text-align: right;"><img src="http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1365/61/3438de35bcca5da9-8716692794_1e7fe9abb1_o.jpg" /><strong><em><span style="align: right; color: #c9c9c9;">photo credit: Brandi Redd</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Precious metals and gems have always been signals of status, or used as gifts to show specialness and honor. As gifts they're a source of pride and value for the giver and the wearer. Accessories in lighter materials can be stylish or meaningful tokens of friendship in childhood.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">All over the world jewelry shines, newly crafted for sale in store windows. However, jewelry is one of the few things that can easily be better with age. When well-made it will hold up and retain value, even with heavy use over time. Good-style keeps it head and shoulders above a century of trends. Better than that, it tells stories. A set of earrings from the 1920s - when being feminine and strong wasn't as easy to pull off as it is today. Material and maker-technique&nbsp;reveal origin. Where did this come from? Who did it belong to? What did it mean to them? What is my relationship to it?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">They are shiny time-machines, giving the wearer an anchor in the past. There is a confidence, a rootedness, a connection to what was and resurgent life in bringing it out again. This is especially true with family heirlooms - antique jewelry that belonged to a loved one, perhaps inherited after they've passed away. A great-grandmother's wedding-band passed down to a new bride. A grandfather's pocket watch. A father's lucky cufflinks gifted to his son upon landing his first real job out of college.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">I had a great-grandmother named Emma, and another named Dorothy. I never really knew either of them, but they became friends late in life. I know parts of their stories from their children and my parents. Dorothy read the Wall Street Journal regularly and had great style - meticulously shopping for each and every item in her closet, carefully recording the prices of each and major events of her day in a diary. Emma grew up in California but moved to Japan in the 1920s for several years (obviously by boat, but it's worth emphasizing for it's relative hard-core-ness compared to our modern jet-setting ways), and gave birth to her first child there. I'm not sure if it's like this for everyone, but for me, putting on a Japanese brooch or lovely earrings that belonged to one of these ladies gives me confidence and vision. They are my crown-jewels - they help me remember where my people came from, and where we could be headed.</p>
<p class="p1 right" style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://philoticconnection.virb.com/shop/186217367" target="_blank"><img src="http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1365/77/5a45193fabffe9eb-IMG_7636_copy_edited.JPG" /></a><span style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="http://philoticconnection.virb.com/shop/186217367" target="_blank"><strong><em>photo&nbsp;by DGTLFI. Vintage Black &amp; White Floral Earrings: $9.50 on the Philotic Connection.</em></strong></a></span></p>
<p class="p1">I'm not saying the past is perfectly nostalgic - flaws (in jewelry and in stories) can sometimes be more engaging and intriguing - more of a source of robust beauty than perfection. That's part of the human experience. What I am saying, is that there are really good reasons that some pieces survive for years and years, and good reasons to give them some thought, and use.</p>
<p class="p1">I sometimes try to think about the things I do - the things I make and work on - in terms of these kinds of high-quality antique jewelry pieces. Will their value last? Will they be something that generations to come - whether my children or not - are drawn to? Is what I'm investing my creative energy and love in telling a story that will ring true to, inspire and strengthen the people who come after me?</p>
<p class="p1">Most of the time, it's really hard to tell. But, when I'm feeling a little jumbled, or just want to pack a little punch in my fashion prowess, putting on some timelessly-gorgeous antique jewelry really does wonders.</p>


//--------------Logo Design - How Can you Choose Just One?

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>by digitalfi</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Designing a logo is NOT&nbsp;easy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It can become overwhelming, especially if you over-think it but it really is the visual representation of the brand, so it has to be good. The logo will be a big part of what differentiates your product from the rest. But, more importantly, your logo design&nbsp;has to capture the essence of the company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So what is our brand?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, we&rsquo;re still working on it and we&rsquo;d like for you all to be a part of our process. If you&rsquo;ve read our <a href="http://philoticconnection.virb.com/about" target="_blank">about&nbsp;page</a>, you know that we&rsquo;re using a concept from one of our favorite science fiction series, Orson Scott Card&rsquo;s <em>Enders Game</em> Series, where it explains the concept of a Philote. A philote in the series is often referred to as an &ldquo;aioua&rdquo; (pronounced I-you-Ah). This aioua is one&rsquo;s intelligent inner self much like what we might believe in as a soul however it is used more as a scientific theory to try and frame several key discoveries in the series; one of which is faster than light travel and communication. I could probably write a whole blog post on the series but I&rsquo;ll leave that for another day.</p>
<p>What stuck with us was the interconnection of species through this philotic web, and the means by which it was used to stop utter chaos and destruction in Ender's Universe. So we wanted to create a brand that would convey our hope to make connections with this world - all of you - through our services.</p>

<li><a href="http://philoticconnection.virb.com/website-development" target="_blank">web design</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With that in mind, the logo design took many days of research, doodling, searching for graphic designers, and getting feedback from friends to find the right design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The research into this theory of interconnected-ness led me to several online pages discussing philosophical or mathematical discoveries:&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_of_Life" target="_blank">the flower of life</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatron's_Cube" target="_blank">metatron&rsquo;s cube</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio" target="_blank">the golden ratio</a>, and all sorts of interesting reads. The one thing I kept noticing between them all was the use of geometry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The flower of life is a series of circles arranged in a certain arrangement that allows for other geometrical figures to be overlaid in certain configurations to create other geometric shapes. Metatron&rsquo;s cube is one of those overlays. The golden ratio, 1.618 - also known as Phi - was already one of my favorite numbers after reading about its amazing ability to be discovered everywhere in nature and architecture. I even had chosen my DJ name after it, <a href="http://philoticconnection.virb.com/dj" target="_blank">DigitalPhi</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of these findings pointed to the use of triangles, circles, squares, and I wanted to use them in our logo.</p>

<div class="mceTemp"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;" class="mceTemp">I have to say here, that I was also looking for examples of logos on the internet and one concept that always captured my attention was the use of the &ldquo;X&rdquo; logo design like the one's seen above. As I kept looking for these types of logos to reference I learned that they were known as the &ldquo;Hipster Logo.&rdquo; I loved the simplicity that the design offered and wanted to somehow incorporate it into the logo as well.</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At first it was the simple "X" with a&nbsp;<span>P and a C on either side. Alone, that covers a lot of ground, especially of what I talked about above about geometry; there are four sides, four triangles pointing inward, and it has a simple clean look.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would have stopped there - but I have to be honest - after finding&nbsp;<a href="http://yourlogoisnothardcore.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">this page</a>&nbsp;online and not being 100% sure - even now - whether it was being sarcastic or not, I was motivated to find something a little more unique.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;" class="mceTemp center"><dl id="attachment_130" class="wp-caption alignright"><dt class="wp-caption-dt"><img style="text-align: center;" class="wp-image-130 center" src="http://philoticconnection.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/538px-copper_symbol-svg.png?w=300" alt="vintage hand made locket style fashion classic jewelry clothes cool blog DJ Event Photography Music Photos Portrait Wedding Party Men's Clothing Hipster Urban DC Beard Oil Natural shirt love cool jacket shirt website design business development marketing" height="214" width="240" /></dt><dt class="wp-caption-dt"></dt></dl></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, I kept looking for ideas. I had been trying to create a logo awhile back with very similar&nbsp;ideas and had draw<span>n out the symbol for copper in one of my notebooks that I was using to doodle out ideas for this logo and found that I liked it. If you&rsquo;ve never seen the symbol for copper it&rsquo;s essentially an X with three lines that cross it at equal distances from each other. The three lines are dots on either side of the X, with the first line being the same length as the third line and the middle line being just a bit shorter. If you look at it closely, the three dots on either side would form a triangle and would be connected to each other.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I experimented with this and came up with the following doodles, keeping some of my&nbsp;ideas going and decided to add a triangle to encapsulate it.<strong><img class="center" style="text-align: center;" src="http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1365/cb/8f79620626f0a2bf-logord1.jpg" alt="vintage hand made locket style fashion classic jewelry clothes cool blog DJ Event Photography Music Photos Portrait Wedding Party Men's Clothing Hipster Urban DC Beard Oil Natural shirt love cool jacket shirt website design business development marketing family connection relationships books" height="300" width="200" /></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From there, I just kept playing with different elements and trying to find what I liked. At the same time I was doing my doodling, I reached out to friends to see if anyone knew someone able to work on helping me design the logo. I got several responses, and after speaking with a few of them I chose to work with a friend I had met in College, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/kaeraz">Kaeili</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kaeili is an awesome artist and I&rsquo;ve seen her do some great typography over the years, so I really wanted to see what she could help me with in this logo. I sent her some of my sketches and told her what our name was. I was pleasantly surprised when she said she was also a fan of the series and would love to work on this logo design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a day or two passed, Kaeli sent me back the first pass at what she was thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="center" style="text-align: center;" src="http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1365/02/cb40deabb89b3a62-ScreenShot2014-03-22at74325AM.png" /><img class="center" style="text-align: center;" src="http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1365/ec/2f6f8c074df45eaf-ScreenShot2014-03-22at74344AM.png" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I loved it but I just couldn&rsquo;t say yes on the first pass so I got back to work and sketched out some more ideas. I wanted to change the logo just a bit, at first glance I loved the design Kaeli chose to work with but after staring at it for a long time I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that it looked like a person jumping up in excitement. I understood the power of that symbol on its own but thought it might be too cheesy so decided to try something different. The logo I had hoped would be similar to the copper symbol bombed and I decided to move away from that concept.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I knew now that I wanted to keep the triangle, the X, and I wanted to have the P and the C in there as well. I just kept trying different combinations of those; the X within the triangle, two dots, no dots. I tried squares and circles and tried stars and all sorts of shapes but the triangle kept coming back.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally I came up with the following sketches and sent them to Kaeli.</p>
<p><img class="left" style="text-align: left;" src="http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1365/94/d1af13f99144965b-WP_20140319_22_09_08_Pro.jpg" padding="" 10px="" alt="vintage hand made locket style fashion classic jewelry clothes cool blog DJ Event Photography Music Photos Portrait Wedding Party Men's Clothing Hipster Urban DC Beard Oil Natural shirt love cool jacket shirt website design business development marketing family connection relationships books" height="300" width="200" /><img class="left" style="text-align: left;" src="http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1365/b7/8a0e89811e7f2e28-WP_20140319_22_38_13_Pro.jpg" alt="vintage hand made locket style fashion classic jewelry clothes cool blog DJ Event Photography Music Photos Portrait Wedding Party Men's Clothing Hipster Urban DC Beard Oil Natural shirt love cool jacket shirt website design business development marketing family connection relationships books" height="300" width="200" /><img class="center" style="text-align: center;" src="http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1365/c2/0a9167e5676d00ed-WP_20140319_22_38_30_Pro.jpg" alt="vintage hand made locket style fashion classic jewelry clothes cool blog DJ Event Photography Music Photos Portrait Wedding Party Men's Clothing Hipster Urban DC Beard Oil Natural shirt love cool jacket shirt website design business development marketing family connection relationships books" height="300" width="200" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then Kaeli sent some choices&nbsp;back, I was impressed but I was also in a tough spot, I liked all of them!&nbsp;How could I choose just one? She had done such an amazing job especially with the typography that I started to feel like the logo was now taking on a life of its own.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p>
<p class="center" style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1365/ea/17748e6315866a2b-k-pre1.png" /></p>
<p><img class="center" style="text-align: center;" src="http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1365/a5/f1e4e7b99f27b655-k-pre2.png" /></p>
<p><img class="center" style="text-align: center;" src="http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1365/0c/06d5a859c9d21aef-k-pre3.png" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The custom typography she made for the brand name conveyed that the product was classy, well made, expensive, all of which are great qualities but then I looked at the logo&nbsp; and its hard edges thought that it was such a juxtaposition that I was unsure if I could use both of them together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That night we went out for a couple of drinks and I kept trying to think of what I could do, but decided that I&rsquo;d get feedback from my friends at the bar and from strangers there as well. I showed them the designs and let them pick their favorite. Overwhelmingly, they picked the design with the custom typeface. Only one chose the design with the triangle and the brand name around the triangle. After asking why, they responded that it looked like the most concise design, and I agreed. But in the end most people chose the design with the custom typeface and I could not disagree.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The only thing that bothered me was that the logo was not in the center. Most people, when asked if they liked it off-center, said yes. Others admittedly said they didn&rsquo;t care because the best thing was the typography.</p>
<p>So the morning came and I still couldn&rsquo;t decide. I got out my laptop and got to work. I moved the logo to the top center, nope. I moved it to the top left, nope. I moved it underneath and covering the &ldquo;Handmade in DC&rdquo; part, nope. I finally moved it and resized it to fit in the bottom center of the typeface and that was it. It just felt right. <br /><br /><strong><img class="center" style="text-align: center;" src="http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1365/45/c288e5e6138a7bae-PhiloticConnection-FinalLogo.jpg" alt="vintage hand made locket style fashion classic jewelry clothes cool blog DJ Event Photography Music Photos Portrait Wedding Party Men's Clothing Hipster Urban DC Beard Oil Natural shirt love cool jacket shirt website design business development marketing family connection relationships books" /></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I sent that image over to Kaeli and told her that was the one. She went ahead and cleaned it up a bit and sent me over the raw files and high res jpgs as well. It was such a pleasure working with her that I recommend anyone looking for a logo design to contact her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hope you enjoyed the read, let us know what your comments are, did we pick the right logo? Do you think our brand is conveyed? What can we do to improve it?</p>

//---------Music Review | Chet Faker

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>by digitalfi</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I first listened to <a href="http://chetfaker.com/" target="_blank">Chet Faker</a> through <a href="http://open.spotify.com/app/wearehunted" target="_blank">Spotify&rsquo;s "We are Hunted" app</a>. The app recently went through a change, they used to be very similar to <a href="http://hypem.com/popular" target="_blank">HypeMachine</a>, but they decided to partner with Twitter and find the most linked to tracks through the service instead of showcasing the most talked about blog links. At first I was hesitant using&nbsp;their beta service and found it was not as great as their previous service. I left them for a while but recently decided to give them another try, this time with their new full app released. <br /><br />I have found several new artists through this app and I have you all in the twiterverse to thank for it. <br /> <iframe width="700" height="375" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/aP_-P_BS6KY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <br />Chet Faker&rsquo;s Talk is Cheap was the song that hooked me. I automatically starred it midway through and have come back to it several times after. Turns out it&rsquo;s his newest single from his upcoming album, Built on Glass, that&rsquo;s due for release on April 15th.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://chetfaker.com/buy" target="blank"><img src="http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1365/56/2392dcd1b8bc77ae-Chet-Faker-Built-On-Glass.jpg" alt="vintage hand made locket style fashion classic jewelry clothes cool blog DJ Event Photography Music Photos Portrait Wedding Party Men's Clothing Hipster Urban DC Beard Oil Natural shirt love cool jacket shirt website design business development marketing family connection relationships books" /></a> <br /><br />His voice, that&rsquo;s what makes me want to keep listening. It&rsquo;s raspy, deep, and it can hit that high all within the same verse. The composition of the song is amazing; the drums make your head bop, the sax keeps the melody throughout the song, a hint of piano, and great vocals throughout the whole song. He&rsquo;s got the perfect mix of several genre&rsquo;s that keep you guessing whether or not you&rsquo;re listening to hip-hop or some indie folk singer.<br /><iframe width="700" height="375" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/HIfFA8-RaHQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br />To my surprise as I dug through Chet Faker&rsquo;s discography I found that he had a No Diggity remix, yup you read that right, a Blackstreet No Diggity remix. Even more surprising was how good it was. It&rsquo;s true to the classic but unique in its own right. It&rsquo;s a mellowed out version that still makes you want to move but this time you want to get your girl and move her in close. His low raspy voice keeps you listening and is the perfect song to listen to with some headphones on. The drums, the background vocals, and the hidden pianos just keep your ears singing with joy.&nbsp; That same weekend I was in New York playing it at a party and got a great response from all my friends.&nbsp;</p>
