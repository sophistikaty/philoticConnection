<p>I shot these photos with the simple idea of looking at every day things in a different perspective. When editing them I began to think of that moment right when you wake up - trying to orient yourself to reality again, and perhaps just holding onto the dregs of a dream-sequence, often being struck by the bizarreness of dreams, If you're like me, it's often difficult to keep this moment together, you either forget the dream entirely, or wait for your consciousness to trickle back into dreamland, forgetting reality. One of the best pieces of advice I've ever gotten is to pay close attention to your thoughts and emotions (even if life demands that you simply press on most of the time) precisely at this moment between sleep and awake - they are usually some of the most honest and revealing. There is some deep sweet beauty - maybe even a piece of the roots of human experience in this moment, which my photos can in no way capture, but perhaps suggest, or explore. I hope you enjoy :)</p>
