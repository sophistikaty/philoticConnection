<p style="text-align: justify;"><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">Welcome! Hopefully you&rsquo;ve purchased our <a href="http://philoticconnection.virb.com/shop/187836786" target="_blank">Philotic Connection Beard Oil </a>and you&rsquo;re ready to start taking control of your beard! Maybe you&rsquo;re on the fence on whether or not you should grow out your beard because of previous experiences and you just need some advice. Either way, we&rsquo;re here for you.</span></big><br /><br /><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">First, growing a beard is easy. Rule number one; don&rsquo;t shave. However, growing an awesome beard takes time, routine, and patience but it&rsquo;ll be worth every second when you get that compliment from&nbsp; random strangers or even better when your significant other loves your beard as much as you do and supports your beard growth. If they need some persuasion show them this:</span></big></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><big><span style="font-size: 16px;"><img src="http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1365/af/5e28b262d954b234-beardpatience.jpg" class="right" style="text-align: right;" height="600" width="449" /></span></big><br /><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">First, let&rsquo;s talk about hair since your beard is not special in that regard.</span></big><br /><br /><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">There are thee different hair types and we mostly all fall into one of these categories: Fine, Medium, Coarse. Our head hair may fall into any of them but our facial hair usually always falls into the Medium/Coarse category. The difference is important. Let&rsquo;s say for instance that your normal hair type is Fine then you probably have soft hair and you are used to not having to use too much shampoo and conditioner to keep it soft. However, if your facial hair is coarse, then your hair will be thick, wiry, wild, and hard to comb. That means you&rsquo;ll have to be proactive about how you wash and condition the beard, that&rsquo;s where beard oil comes into play.</span></big><br /><br /><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">Sadly it&rsquo;s not that easy, not only do we have to worry about our hair type when deciding to grow a beard, we also have to be thinking of our skin type, otherwise we will never get past that dry/itchy phase. The different types of skin are: Normal, Dry, and Oily. Some of us might even have sensitive skin or a combination of the three but let&rsquo;s make this simple and stick to the three.&nbsp;</span></big><br /><br /><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">Your skin type will define your daily wash routine for you. For example, if you have normal skin, washing your face more than twice a day is not a bad thing, however; if you have Oily or Dry skin it may not be advised, especially if you&rsquo;re not prepared with a good conditioning/moisturizing routine. Why? Well the act of washing your hair means you are removing the natural oil (sebum) produced by the body from the hair and that can lead to dry hair or skin. Dry skin then leads to blemishes which causes the body to overcompensate and release more oil in an effort to moisturize the hair and skin but that usually leads to clogged pores which then lead to Acne and Blackheads. All in all a pretty bad experience but even more so when trying to grow out a beard.&nbsp;</span></big><br /><br /><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">The power of beard oil is that it helps with this process by telling your body not to overproduce any oil. How? Depending on the carrier oil that is used in your beard oil it will have different effects but here at Philotic Connection we use the most expensive and best 100% natural products to create our beard oil. We use a base of Jojoba Oil which is technically not an oil, it&rsquo;s really a type of wax, that is the closest to our natural sebum and is known not to clog any pores since it acts closest to our own natural oil. It also has some pretty great anti-microbial properties to help clean up any dirt and bacteria lingering in your beard. Using this base oil and our own essential oil mix we provide some of the best beard oil in the market by creating a unique and wonderful smell for your beard and acts as a leave-in conditioner. Our essential oil mix is specifically crafted to help target and prevent those blemishes and acne from ever popping up to keep your beard and skin happy.</span></big><br /><br /><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">Now that we know why beard oil is important lets talk about what a daily wash routine should be.</span></big><br /><br /><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">When showering, most people&nbsp;usually wash their body with soap and their hair with shampoo and for guys, if we&rsquo;re good, we use conditioner. However, it can often cause chronic problems with the condition of the hair and skin underneath when you&nbsp;wash your hair with shampoo more than three times a week and that goes for our beards as well. We&rsquo;re currently working on creating a beard friendly shampoo that is free of sulfates and has the right amount of oils to promote healthy growth and shine but using your normal shampoo should be just fine for now. The important point to remember is to use our beard oil to condition your beard after every shower, not just the three days you shampoo your beard. After a while you can go down to three days, then to fewer times, but start with using our beard oil every day.</span></big><br /><br /><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">Usage:</span></big></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">If you have oily skin, you probably use a daily face wash to combat acne, continue doing so.&nbsp;</span></big></li>
<li><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">Wash your beard with shampoo and rinse thoroughly.</span></big></li>
<li><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">When you&rsquo;re out of the shower pat dry your beard with your towel. (This prevents you from damaging your hair.)</span></big></li>
<li><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">Once your hair is dry, place five to ten drops of our beard oil onto your dry palm and spread over your fingertips.</span></big></li>
<li><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">Rub in beard oil onto your hair and massage your skin as you work through your beard (As time goes on, you should only be applying oil to the hair and not the skin but in the beginning your skin needs some love too.)</span></big></li>
<li><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">If you have a long beard you should repeat steps 4 and 5 until you feel that most of the beard is covered in oil. The beard shouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;wet&rdquo; or dripping with oil it should just be shiny.</span></big></li>
<li><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">Once you have rubbed in the beard oil, comb your beard down</span></big></li>
<li><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">This will spread the oil over the hair and should start training your hair to fall into place.</span></big></li>
<li><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">We recommend using a wooden comb but any long-tooth comb should work.</span></big></li>
<li><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">We also recommend combing down your hair every morning and night to help with its training</span></big></li>
<li><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">No matter the length of beard you&rsquo;re trying to achieve you will have to trim your beard regularly to prevent split ends and to just keep it from getting too out of control. Plus the act of trimming your hair actually stimulates growth. (Any ten dollar pair of shears should work.)</span></big></li>
<li><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">You want to focus on the hair on your cheeks that stick out even after a few combs. If you&rsquo;re going for a longer beard you should be trimming at least every three weeks, yes it will actually help with its growth. Remember you shouldn&rsquo;t be trimming too much, the best rule is &ldquo;Cut a little then sleep on it.&rdquo; You can always come back tomorrow to touch up some more but you can&rsquo;t grow back your hair in one night if you cut off too much.</span></big></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">If you&rsquo;re already growing a long beard you should start this process now, it might take a little longer to see some results but keep at it and you&rsquo;ll see the benefits of softer hair, healthy skin, and a controlled beard.&nbsp; Also, keep coming back to check for an awesome new handmade product we&rsquo;re working on just for you to jumpstart the process.</span></big><br /><br /><big><span style="font-size: 16px;">Thanks for reading, if you have any questions feel free to contact us!</span></big></p>
